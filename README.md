# connect5
Simple minimax-based AI to play a Connect5 or Go-Moku game.

This implements an AI agent (based on the minimax algorithm) to play a Connect 5 game in which each player tries to connect five of their pieces while preventing their adversary to connect 5 of their pieces. For now only vertical and horizontal directions are supported. Also, the User Interface is very basic.

To run, type in your terminal:

  python connectFiveGUI.py

This game is also known as Go-Moku or Five-in-a-row or Gobang
